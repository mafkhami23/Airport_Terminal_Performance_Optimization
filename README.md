This Python-based project analyzes indoor air quality sensor data by merging datasets, performing statistical analysis, generating timeframe plots for each parameter, and detecting outliers based on industry thresholds.

# Features

Analyzed air quality in nine different spaces within a three-story office building to understand variations throughout the day.
The raw data from sensors was extracted,processed and cleaned sensor data to further analysis.
Examined key parameters, including:
- COâ‚‚ levels
- Temperature
- Noise levels
- Light intensity
- Sound levels</br>

In the next step, the values that exceeds the standard thresholds were idenitfied and graphed out for better visualization
