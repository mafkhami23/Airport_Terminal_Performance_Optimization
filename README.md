# ✈️ Human Experience in Aviation: A Design Research Study  
**From Journey Mapping to Sensor Analytics – A Holistic View of Experience Design**

![CO2_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/328bfe5d-5877-4228-aa54-d698d857bb1d)

## 🧠 Overview  

Airports are emotionally and physically complex environments. This project explores the **full spectrum of passenger experience**—from the emotional journey of navigating a terminal to the physiological effects of indoor air quality (IAQ) on comfort and performance. The research was conducted as part of the Ontario International Airport Authority (ONT)’s Experiential Objectives Analysis (EOA).

> 🧩 This project exemplifies how **mixed-methods research**, **behavioral science**, and **data analytics** combine to improve human experience and drive **business-aligned design decisions**—the exact mandate of Capital One’s Experience Design Research team.


## 👣 Research Objectives  

- Understand and improve the **passenger journey** across touchpoints  
- Prioritize improvements that reduce stress and improve decision-making  
- Evaluate **environmental comfort factors** through sensor analysis  
- Translate behavioral insights into **actionable strategies** for design, investment, and operations  

---

## 🔍 Multi-Phase Methodology  

This study was executed across three primary layers of research:

### 🧭 1. Journey & Behavioral Mapping  

- **Contextual Observations** across terminal touchpoints  
- **Journey Mapping** of different traveler personas (e.g., new parent, elderly traveler, solo flyer)  
- **Behavioral Mapping** to identify real-time decisions, bottlenecks, and stress triggers  
- **Persona Development grounded in real data**—generated from interviews, ethnography, and behavior tracking  

### 👁️ 2. Visibility & Navigation Pain Points  

- **Visibility Analysis** of gates vs. amenities (e.g., food, restrooms, water stations)  
- Eye-tracking simulations to validate behavior: passengers prioritize gate visibility over amenities  
- Mapped decision paralysis caused by poor environmental cues  
- Identified opportunities for **wayfinding improvement and revenue uplift**  

> “Passengers would rather eat something less desirable that’s near the gate than explore unknown options—they’re afraid of missing their flight.”

### 💡 Key Design Recommendations  

- Add **digital terminal maps** with real-time walking distances  
- Introduce **localized dining options** to increase sense of place  
- Long-term redesign suggestions to **maximize line-of-sight visibility** across concessions

## 🌡️ 3. Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Analysis – A Physiological Layer of Human Experience  

While journey mapping addressed emotional and cognitive load, we also investigated the **physiological comfort** of passengers and employees through **environmental sensor analysis**.

### 🧪 IAQ Sensor Study  

- Conducted across 9 unique spaces in a 3-story terminal office  
- Collected and cleaned sensor data (CO₂, Temperature, Noise, Light, Sound)  
- Performed **threshold-based outlier detection**  
- Visualized patterns to inform **comfort, fatigue, and alertness levels**

### 📊 Parameters Tracked  

- **CO₂** – proxy for air quality & ventilation effectiveness  
- **Temperature** – thermal comfort & productivity correlation  
- **Noise & Sound** – stress and cognitive overload  
- **Light** – visual strain and circadian alignment

### 📈 Visual Highlights  

#### CO₂ Levels Over Time

#### Temperature Fluctuation

#### CO₂ Radar View

> These IAQ findings were triangulated with passenger behavioral maps to uncover “comfort deserts” in the terminal—spaces with both cognitive and physiological friction.

## 🎯 Strategic Outcomes  

- **Prioritized improvements** based on real user pain points  
- Aligned **behavioral, emotional, and environmental data** for holistic design strategy  
- Delivered **short-term wins** (signage, visibility fixes) and **long-term investments** (architectural adjustments, IAQ retrofits)  
- Created a replicable model for **data-driven experiential design**

---

## 🧩 Relevance to Capital One Design Research  

This project illustrates:

- Leading **end-to-end primary research** (qual & quant)  
- Enabling **faster learning velocity** through mixed-method insights  
- Bridging emotional, behavioral, and physical experience data  
- Clear communication of findings to influence high-stakes decisions  
- Deep alignment with **human-centered**, **business-focused**, and **data-integrated design strategy**  

---

## 📎 Final Takeaway  

Designing great experiences starts with understanding people—how they think, feel, move, and breathe in a space. This project demonstrates how **integrated design research** can move beyond assumptions and into measurable outcomes. I bring this same **strategic, human-centered mindset** to every research challenge—and I’m excited to continue applying it in new contexts like financial services.
