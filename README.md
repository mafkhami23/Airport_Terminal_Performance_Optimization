# Indoor-Air-Quality-Sensor
Indoor Air Quality Data Analysis is a Python-based project that aims to merge indoor air quality sensor data, perform statistical analysis, generate timeframe plots for each parameter, and detect outliers based on industry thresholds.
Features

    Merges data from multiple indoor air quality sensors into a single dataset for analysis.
    Calculates statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, correlations) for the sensor data.
    Generates timeframe plots for each parameter to visualize trends over time.
    Identifies outliers in the data using industry-defined thresholds.
